*   Script development (ex: command-line scripts) are a consistent part of my quality approach and are written using industry standard best practices.

**Architecture Design**

*   I‚Äôm able to decompose a complex problem or business scenario and understand how software components interact with each other. My understanding of system architecture is evident in the quality practices I deploy.

**Quality Assessment**

*   I am hyper-focused on delivering risk-driven quality management solutions that are founded in quality metrics/measurements I gather and report to my QE team and cross-functional partners.
*   I actively advocate for inclusion on quality metrics/measurements in my QE teams reporting that represent both industry best practices and a deep understanding of my engineering domain (ex: Full Stack, FE, BE, Mobile) and how it is represented within my scope of work
