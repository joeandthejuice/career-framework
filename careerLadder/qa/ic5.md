üèÜ Results
----------

**Impact**

*   I identify and execute on opportunities that have area/group-wide impact

*   I am able to deeply understand technical designs with multiple components interacting across API or system boundaries. I effectively build and execute quality management strategies that uncover technical bugs/failures between components. Based on my deep knowledge of the features/infrastructure/tooling supporting features in my products, I‚Äôm able to surface risks and potential mismatches in expectations between system components.

**Technical Strategy**
