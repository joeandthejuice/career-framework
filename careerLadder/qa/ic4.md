ü¶â Craft
--------

**Software Design**

*   I am able to give quality feedback on technical designs for both feature and test infrastructure designs written by cross-functional partners (ex: can include development of multiple features/components together) and QE peers. I ask probing, insightful questions that solidify choices and surface erroneous assumptions.
*   I effectively and quickly debug cross-module issues, and may intuit where bugs might lie due to my deep knowledge of revenue and customer impacting workflows.

**Architecture Design**

*   I am able to deeply understand technical designs with multiple components interacting across API or system boundaries. I effectively build and execute test scenarios that uncover technical bugs/failures between components. Based on my deep knowledge of the features/infrastructure/tooling supporting features in my products, I‚Äôm able to surface risks and potential mismatches in expectations between system components.
*   I effectively manage quality for major feature development projects and major refactor projects reliably - including generating and reporting quality metrics/measurements, active participation in technical and design spec reviews, and surfacing and reporting on risks throughout the PDLC
