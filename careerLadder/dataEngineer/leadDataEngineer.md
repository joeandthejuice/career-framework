ü¶â Craft
--------

**Code Fluency**

*   The expectations for L3 code fluency are still applicable here (though some specialist engineers may go deep in this area)
*   I look for ways to simplify code and data models. I prioritize tasks that lead to lower data and system maintenance and migration costs with meaningful and measurable impact.
*   I can find ways to improve developer efficiency as measured by cycle time, ramp-up time, or other similar measurements.
*   I preemptively identify and resolve technical risks before they jeopardize the project. I resolve cross-team dependencies earlier to ensure the successful execution of the project.
*   I avoid re-inventing the wheel by leveraging other JOE & THE JUICE solutions or off-the-shelf solutions with the possible trade-off in mind. I write modules and data models that can be extended and adopted by other teams at JOE & THE JUICE to increase their efficiency.

**Software Design**

*   I am responsible for designing the software or systems required in my area of ownership and ensuring that they meet their design objectives.
*   I am able to give quality feedback on designs written by other members of my team, asking probing, insightful questions that solidify choices and surface erroneous assumptions
*   I effectively and quickly debug cross-module issues, and may intuit where bugs might lie due to my deep knowledge of the data models, platforms, and systems that my data models rely on

**Architecture Design**

*   I‚Äôm able to create coherent designs with multiple components interacting across interface or data pipeline task boundaries; bugs do not creep in at the boundaries between components due to mismatches in expectations of what is technically feasible; designs across data boundaries take into account performance, usability, and logical separation of data layers
*   I‚Äôm capable of rolling out a component, major feature, or complex data pipeline (and deprecating an existing system, feature, or data pipeline) reliably - including appropriate monitoring, paging, etc are in place, and that failure domains are understood and characterized appropriately before large scale rollout. For prototype capabilities or data models, I am able to roll out with an eye toward achieving learning goals untainted by poor quality.
*   I avoid introducing toil and future maintenance work by proactively avoiding scaling issues and providing adequate documentation.
*   I design clear success metrics and achieve those metrics consistently post-launch through the lifetime of the system, feature, or data pipeline.

**Technical Strategy**

*   I‚Äôm responsible for alignment of the software and data models in my team to overall technical and data strategy, making tradeoffs where appropriate in consultation with staff engineers

**Business Acumen**

*   I engage in listening sessions (All Hands, Quarterly Business Updates, etc.) to increase my learning and guide my work/priorities
*   I have a working knowledge of JOE & THE JUICE‚Äôs org/team structure and how teams work together across JOE & THE JUICE, and am able to help my team effectively collaborate effectively with other teams across our org
