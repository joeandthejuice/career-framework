ü¶â Craft
--------

**Code Fluency**

*   The expectations for L3 code fluency are still applicable here (though some specialist engineers may go deep in this area)
*   I look for ways to simplify code and infrastructure. I prioritize tasks that lead to lower system and infrastructure maintenance and migration costs with meaningful and measurable impact.
*   I can find ways to improve developer efficiency as measured by cycle time, ramp-up time, or other similar measurements.
*   I preemptively identify and resolve technical risks before they jeopardize the project. I resolve cross-team dependencies earlier to ensure the successful execution of the project.
*   I avoid re-inventing the wheel by leveraging other Joe & the Juice solutions or off-the-shelf solutions with the possible trade-off in mind. I write libraries and modules that can be extended and adopted by other teams at Joe & the Juice to increase their efficiency.

**Software Design**

*   I am responsible for designing the software or systems required in my area of ownership and ensuring that they meet their design objectives.
*   I am able to give quality feedback on designs written by other members of my team, asking probing, insightful questions that solidify choices and surface erroneous assumptions
*   I effectively and quickly debug cross-module issues, and may intuit where bugs might lie due to my deep knowledge of the libraries, platforms, and systems that my software relies on

**Architecture Design**

*   I‚Äôm able to create coherent designs with multiple components interacting across API or system boundaries; bugs do not creep in at the boundaries between components due to mismatches in expectations of what is technically feasible
*   I‚Äôm capable of rolling out a component or major feature (and deprecating an existing system or feature) reliably - including appropriate monitoring, paging, etc are in place, and that failure domains are understood and characterized appropriately before large scale rollout. For early stage products, I am able to roll out with an eye toward achieving learning goals untainted by poor quality.
*   I avoid introducing toil and future maintenace work by proactively avoiding scaling issues and providing adequate documentation.
*   I design clear success metrics and achieve those metrics consistently post-launch through the lifetime of the system or feature. For early stage products, those success metrics may be oriented around learning goals rather than usage goals, given the inherent unpredictability of achieving product/market fit.

**Technical Strategy**

*   I‚Äôm responsible for alignment of the software and systems in my team to overall technical strategy, making tradeoffs where appropriate in consultation with staff engineers

**Business Acumen**

*   I engage in listening sessions (All Hands, Quarterly Business Updates, etc.) to increase my learning and guide my work/priorities
*   I have a working knowledge of Joe & the Juice‚Äôs org/team structure and how teams work together across Joe & the Juice, and am able to help my team effectively collaborate effectively with other teams across our org
