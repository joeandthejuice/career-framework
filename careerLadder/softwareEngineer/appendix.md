# Glossary

We’re striving to use clear language, but there are a few words where it’s helpful to expound upon how we interpret them.

## Craft Responsibility Definitions

The responsibilities defined below make up the foundation of the Software Engineer craft:

- **Code fluency:** The ability to read and write code fluently and well.
- **Software design:** The ability to design software components with reasonable APIs and interaction patterns (writing good classes, modules, etc - building out a box in your architecture diagram)
- **Architecture design:** The ability to design systems of interacting components - e.g. a collection of interacting features or the architecture of a product, binary or significant service (what are the boxes in your architecture diagram, how do they interact)
- **Technical strategy:** Ensuring the right long-term technical decisions are being made by the organization - knowing what systems to build; making technical choices when there are not clear solutions. What standards apply to all the boxes in the organizations architecture diagrams?

## Overall Responsibility Definitions

Delivery teams has the many responsibilities from security, processes etc to Engineering Practices and code quality and so on. To help clarify how these roles and definitions boil down to everyday work we got a little help from our dear friend Chatgpt to help compile a list.
