🌠 Joe Engineering Values

👭 We Focus On People
---------

If we enjoy what we do, we do it better. So we build a culture where we can be ourselves. We focus on our strengths, not our weaknesses. And we celebrate our differences because they make us stronger.

💪 We Own It
---------

We take responsibility for our work, from start to finish. When we get stuck, we unblock ourselves. When something goes wrong, we don’t ask, “What did _they_ screw up?” but “What could _I_ do better?” We learn from our mistakes and keep going—until we have real impact. We start something, we finish it.

✨ We Keep It Simple
----------------

Our organization is impatient. They want things yesterday. Thats fair. So we focus on whats important. We keep it simple. We dont overcomplicate. We dont overthink. We dont overplan. We dont overpromise. We dont overengineer. We dont overwork. We focus on the essential but we never compromise on quality!

❤️ We Make Work Human
------------------

We focus on people, not processes. We value people, not titles. We remove obstacles and we always ask if there is something we can do to make work more enjoyable.
