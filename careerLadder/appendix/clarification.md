Engineering Career Framework Clarifications and Myths
=====================================================

**The Engineering Career Framework has so many behaviors to exhibit, do I need to exemplify them all for a promotion?**

This framework is not a checklist. This is a guide to help you figure out what your impact could look like at the next level. Working directly with your manager to understand which areas you should spend more or less time on is the most effective way to align goals and expectations for your role.

Additionally, individuals take on different personas that might focus on different areas more heavily, which is why we have also added an [Archetypes section](archetypes_behaviors.html) to further help dispel the idea that everyone must check all the boxes.

**The career framework favors deeper and more complex projects rather than a breadth of projects that deliver customer value.**

The focus in the career framework has shifted towards driving impact in order to align with company goals in delivering value, and less around complex projects. Impact takes many forms ranging from product and domain expertise to project and technical leadership. Read more in the career framework’s “[What is Impact](what_is_impact.html)” page, where you’ll also notice it has no mention of complexity.

**The career framework doesn’t provide guidance on how to move to the next level, just an end state of the qualities one needs to have.**

The best way to understand how to move to the next level is to have transparent conversations with your manager about your goals and gaps. The framework is not an exhaustive list of behaviors, as every individual, team, and project is different. That said, new content has been added with the [Promotion Guidelines](promotion_guidelines.html) and [Promotion Principles](promotion_principles.html) to provide additional clarity for you.
