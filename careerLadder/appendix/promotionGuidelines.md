Promotion Guidelines
====================

This chart summarizes our promotion guidelines. It captures:

*   Expectations for typical **velocity** through the levels
*   Expectations for the **career level** for ICs and managers: we expect all engineers to grow to have that level of impact or greater over time

| Level | Typical time in level for ICs (years) | Typical time in level for managers (years) |  
|-------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| L1    | 1.5-2                                 | n/a                                        | 
| L2    | 2-3                                   | n/a                                        | 
| L3    | 2-4                                   | 0-2*                                       | 
| L4    | L4	4+ We expect all engineers to grow to have L4-level impact or greater over time. L4 will be a career level for many engineers.                                  | We expect all engineering managers to grow to have L4-level impact or greater over time. L4 will be a career level for many engineers.                                       |   
|     |                                   | 	*Manager time in L3 is shorter than IC because ICs transferring to management are expected to have already grown through much of the L3 level                        |  


Everybody can recommend someone for a promotion at any time. Promotions will usually be given on halfyearly review meetings. 
In order for a promotion to be granted, it has to be argued for and agreed upon by the manager and the CTO.
