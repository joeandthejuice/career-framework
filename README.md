## What’s a Career Framework?

The Engineering Ladder is our framework for meaningful conversations around the expectations for your role and your future growth.
We've based heavily on Dropbox engineering framework, but we've made some changes to better fit our needs.
First, a disclaimer. The same disclaimer can also be found in the source material from Dropbox.

### What the Career Framework is not

This framework is not a promotion checklist for your role; rather, it’s designed to help you figure out what your impact could look like at the next level.

This framework is not an exhaustive list of examples and behaviors; each responsibility includes three to four key behaviors that serve as guide for how to think about your work. Consequently, you’ll need to meet with your manager to define your impact goals and align on the expectations for your role.

### Why is this important?

We need to set the stage for what to expect from each other. What is a senior doing? How do you progress? These questions dont have a clear answer, but the engineering ladder can help provide guidance, set expectations and help us set individual goals based on common understanding.

### Why should you spend your time on this?

Well, you dont need to. But you should at least familiarize yourself with the expectations for you current role and whats expected from you to progress. 
Your manager is responsible to making sure you understand what you role have and what the expectations to that role is.

Futhermore, we are growing. And with the increased headcount, we need to be able to set expectations for new hires and help them understand what is expected from them as well.

### Why have you spend your time on this? Shouldnt you be working?

Sure, there is always work to be done. But as a manager, one of your main responsibilities is to take of the people you manage. And providing you with clear view of expectations will also give you better psychological safety. Thats at least the hopes for this down the line.

### Do I need to progress?

No, we dont expect everyone to progress. Some people are happy with their current role and thats fine. But if you want to progress in Joe, we want to help you get there. Sometimes stale is fine, and sometimes we want more.

### How do I use this document?

This document is meant to be used as a guide for your 1:1s with your manager. You should use it to set goals and expectations for your current role. Again, its not a checklist, but a more holistic view of what the different roles can look like.
You as a manager should use this document to help set expecations to the people you are managing.
